Hello, My name is Okposong Daniel Ebong. I am a Nigerian software developer based in Munich who is proficient in both frontend and backend development, spanning web, mobile, and command-line applications. This flexibility makes me a strong fit for various roles in software development. 

Having worked in fintech, agriculture, e-commerce, and most recently the electronics industries, I can adapt really quickly  and have an understanding of how technology drives success across industries. Additionally, I have experience in design thinking, project management, and agile workflows. Therefore I can contribute beyond just coding.

My passion for turning complex problems into intuitive, high-quality products with an astute attention to detail is one of my strong suites. I prioritise strong Communication & Team Collaboration, which I believe is a crucial for effectively achieving business goals
